Coding club notes
=================

Here you will find all the notes for the RB coding club.

They are divided by discipline category.
As such, you will find all notes related to Python in the python folder, JavaScript in javascript folders etc.

You can also download these files and run them using Jupyter Notebook (instructions in python folder).

## How to use this

Not everything on this GitHub page can be directly viewed. For instance, a slideshow won't show just like that.
In order to get a copy of everything here. Simply click the download button. Here you get the option to download
all files as a ZIP file, or to use a GitHub clone URL.

If you are unsure how Git works, I recommend downloading the ZIP file.
However, if you know about Git, or are feeling adventurous, you can try using the GitHub URL.

## Contributing

If you would like to contribute your work directly here. Use Git and clone this repository.
Once you have done that, place the work, or changes where you would like them to be, and do a
'Pull Request'.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask me, or any programmers and designer.
